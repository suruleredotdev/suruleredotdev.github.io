## Example: Use deck.gl with react-map-gl and Webpack

Uses [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle files and serves it
with [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server).

## Usage

To install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Commands:
* `npm start` is the development target, to serve the app and hot reload.
* `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle and write to disk.

### Basemap

The basemap in this example is provided by [CARTO free basemap service](https://carto.com/basemaps). To use an alternative base map solution, visit [this guide](https://deck.gl/docs/get-started/using-with-map#using-other-basemap-services)
