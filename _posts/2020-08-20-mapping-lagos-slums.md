66% percent of Lagos's population lives in slums. This map visualizes where these populations are located, as a way to make visible these communities and the issues facing them. Some of these issues include displacement and disbursement by state authorities, as well as fires, sanitation concerns, electrification and flooding.

Lagos slums include, Makoko – the infamous floating slum and Otodo Gbame - which was illegally cleared by local authorities leaving it's inhabitats displaced.

  These communities are perhaps the most visible manifestation of the profound income inequality in Lagos. While the oil and finance industries have buoyed a few thousand Lagosians into stratospheric wealth (marked by gleaming black Escalades and boutique markets selling French oysters), one-fifth of the city's 21 million residents are either living in or at risk of poverty, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3719246-NGA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 Oxford University study</a>.

        It is a cluster of houses on stilts in the shallow waters of the Lagoon near Ebute Metta,

        In July 2012, The Lagos-state government ordered that stilt houses that were built beyond the string of 
        powerlines be torn down to prevent the slum from expanding further out into the Lagoon, while apparently only giving residents 72 hours of notice. 3000 people lost their homes to this exercise.

## Why Slums are Important
Slums in some form or the other are common to urban areas all around the world. 
A better term for slums might be "unplanned" or "organic" urban settlements, which are settlements which form when migrants to a city or 
displaced people who build their own settlements from scratch because formal housing is too expensive and the government is 
unable to provide sufficient housing for these groups. 
Slums are often heavily populated, lack public services and don't offer long-term tenure.

Urban researchers view slums as central to cities life forces and a bastion of equality in a sense since people can take it upon 
themselves to plan out and construct their own enclaves within the matrix of a city. 
But slums are generally considered to be illegal in cities because the government does not approve them prior to their construction, hence 
they might be demolished or otherwise penalized by the government. 
Researchers like [Eugenie L Birch](https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning/phd/people/eugenie-l-birch) have argued that cities 
would be better off embracing slums and empowering residents to build more sanitary lodgings that are more resistant to fire and flooding. 
In addition to this, slums can be recognized as legitimate settlements and receive investments to build schools, libraries and other 
community resources.

Alternative settlements in slums can also be models of more sustainable architecture. The Slums of Medellin in Colombia are good examples of integrating city infrastructure and amenities with organic or unplanned settlements. like cable cars that take residents to the center of the city and well-situated community spaces. This sort of collaboration between individual agency, community organization and government support might just be the best means that cities will have with managing their swelling populations. 

Contrast this against the habit of cities to undergo big "ultramodern" development projects in order to attract foreign 
investment and new enclaves for the super rich to further insulate them from the rest of the growing urban population. 
Lagos' Eko Atlantic is the latest in a long string of residential and commercial mega-projects aimed at "modernizing" the 
city, while largely ignoring the complex factors of urbanization and taking away money that would otherwise be very well suited for 
transporation and cultural infrastructure.

  More fundamentally, however, the central promise of Eko Atlantic—that it is possible to ‘start over’ and build an exclusive city within a city—is flawed. The high property values clearly illustrate the class of urban resident the new city hopes to attract. But these urban elites require a huge number of service workers; drivers, cooks, street sweepers, recharge card sellers, barbers, construction workers, mechanics and more to sustain their lifestyles. In cities, everyone wants to live where the jobs are and where the economic buzz is greatest. Even if the urban poor of Lagos are priced out from the fancy new developments of Eko Atlantic, they will find their way to informal settlements and abandoned properties. Based on the share of Lagosians who can realistically afford to live in Eko Atlantic, many of the residential buildings are likely to be empty anyway. Even Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Banana Island already have vacancy rates as high as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/eko-atlantic-city-eyes-2023-finish-as-nigeria-economy-rebounds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 per cent</a> in their wealthier areas.

Indeed, slums can be looked at as an opportunity to innovatively support large underserved communities in cities like Lagos. As urban populations grow in the developing world, cities have become centers of

This article is the first in a series of posts where we'll try to shed light on various geopolitical issues in urban areas across the continent. 
I've been getting my hands dirty with GIS tools to build familiarity 
so I can make the maps more visually engaging and interactive, which has a weird full-circle-feel to it -- my Dad's an architect and 
GIS consultant and my first few "internships" were at his office in Onikan messing around with AutoCAD.
